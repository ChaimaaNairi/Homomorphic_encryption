# Homomorphic-Encryption
This project is an implementation of homomorphic encryption using the Paillier cryptosystem. It demonstrates how homomorphic encryption can be used for secure computation in a distributed setting, where data is encrypted and processed by different parties without revealing the underlying data to any of the parties. </br>
