# Homomorphic-Encryption

<b>Homomorphic encryption</b> is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, is the same as if the computation were done on plaintext. This means that data can be processed and analyzed without being exposed, making it a promising technique for privacy-preserving machine learning.

In this project, we explore the application of homomorphic encryption to machine learning. Specifically, we implement a linear regression model using encrypted data, so that the data remains private throughout the analysis.
